## Description
This is a Python library implementing a 3D vector class (Vector) with various useful methods for vector operations. It provides a convenient way to perform common vector calculations in 3-dimensional space.

## Project Status üöß

This project is currently in active development. While the core functionality is stable and well-tested, we're working on:

- Additional optimization opportunities
- Expanded documentation and examples
- More advanced vector operations
- Better integration with scientific Python ecosystems

**We welcome contributions!** See the [Contributing](https://github.com/ManvendraSingh-007/vector/edit/master/README.md#contributing) section below.

## Features

- üßÆ Basic vector operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
- üìè Geometric calculations (magnitude, normalization, dot/cross products)
- üìê Advanced operations (projection, rejection, reflection, rotation)
- üîÑ Conversion methods (to/from tuples, lists)
- üîç Comparison and ordering based on magnitude
- ‚ö° Magnitude caching for performance
- üêç Pythonic interface with special methods

## Installation

Simply copy the `vector.py` file into your project and import it:

```python
from vector import Vector
```

## Different ways to create vectors
```python
v1 = Vector(1, 2, 3)                 # Using coordinates
v2 = Vector.zero()                   # Zero vector (0, 0, 0)
v3 = Vector.unit()                   # Unit vector (1, 1, 1)
v4 = Vector.from_tuple((4, 5, 6))    # From tuple
```

## Vector operations
```python
a = Vector(1, 2, 3)
b = Vector(4, 5, 6)

# Basic arithmetic
sum_vec = a + b
diff_vec = a - b
scaled_vec = a * 2
divided_vec = a / 2

# Dot and cross products
dot_product = a.dot_product(b)
cross_product = a.cross_product(b)

# Magnitude and normalization
magnitude = a.magnitude()
normalized = a.normalize()
```

## Geometric calculation
```python
# Angle between vectors
angle_deg = a.angle_between(b)  # in degrees
angle_rad = a.angle_between(b, degrees=False)  # in radians

# Projections
projection = a.project_onto(b)
rejection = a.reject_from(b)

# Reflection
normal = Vector(0, 1, 0)
reflected = a.reflect_across(normal)

# Rotation
axis = Vector(1, 0, 0)
rotated = a.rotate(45, axis)  # 45 degree rotation around x-axis
```

## Methods Overview
`magnitude()`

`normalize()`

`dot_product(other)`

`cross_product(other)`

`angle_between(other, degrees=True)`

`project_onto(other)`

`reject_from(other)`

`reflect_across(normal)`

`rotate(angle, axis)`

`is_zero()`, `is_parallel(other)`, `is_perpendicular(other)`, `is_orthogonal(other)`

`distance_to(other)`

`lerp(other, t)`

## Operator Overloading
`+`, `-` for vector addition/subtraction

`*`, `/` for scalar multiplication/division

`==`, `<` for comparisons

`[]` for indexing

`len()` for number of dimensions

`bool()` for zero-check

`str()` and `repr()` for printing

`format()` for custom decimal formatting
